about_content: | 
  Dedicated to democratising health optimisation, I focus on transforming complex health data into clear, actionable
  insights through AI technology and scientific frameworks.

  Drawing on decades of experience in digital transformation and strategic business execution, combined with an
  extensive personal health optimisation journey, I work to empower everyone to understand their health patterns and
  take early action.

  Through HappyLongevity, AI-Powered Longevity Navigation Platform, we aim to deliver AI-enabled, data-driven insights and practical solutions that make preventive
  health optimisation accessible and understandable for all - because staying healthy shouldn't require a medical degree.
