career_summary: >
  Across my career spanning global finance, technology leadership, and strategic consulting, 
  I've focused on one consistent mission: transforming complex data into actionable insights 
  that solve real problems for people and organizations.
  
  This balanced approach has enabled me to deliver significant business outcomes through 
  technology-driven transformation—from increasing financial visibility across 120+ countries 
  at Maersk, to driving exponential growth in AWS's Nordic financial services, to leading a 
  enterprise-scale portfolio of cloud and AI implementations at Accenture.
  
  My career path evolved naturally from global treasury and financial operations, to digital 
  banking transformation, to cloud and AI implementation leadership—always maintaining a focus 
  on solving intricate business challenges through customer-centric innovation.
