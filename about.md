# About Julia Persson

![Julia Persson](/images/JP_founder.jpeg)

## Mission

Dedicated to democratising health optimisation, I focus on transforming complex health data into clear, actionable insights through AI technology and scientific frameworks.

## Background

Drawing on decades of experience in digital transformation and strategic business execution, combined with an extensive personal health optimisation journey, I work to empower everyone to understand their health patterns and take early action.

Through HappyLongevity, AI-Powered Longevity Navigation Platform, we aim to deliver AI-enabled, data-driven insights and practical solutions that make preventive health optimisation accessible and understandable for all - because staying healthy shouldn't require a medical degree.

## Our Approach

1. **Scientific Validation** - Rigorous frameworks based on medical research
2. **AI-Powered Analysis** - Multi-LLM architecture for reliable health insights
3. **Data Integration** - Connecting diverse biomarker, genetic, and lifestyle data
4. **Personalized Recommendations** - Tailored health optimisation strategies
5. **Early Risk Detection** - Identifying patterns before they become problems
